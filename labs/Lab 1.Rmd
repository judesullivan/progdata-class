## Introduction

Welcome everyone! My name is Jude and I am a senior at the *University of South Florida*.

## Exploring Penguins

Let's explore some penguins!

```{r}
library(tibble)
```

```{r penguins}
library(palmerpenguins)

palmerpenguins::penguins

penguins_tbl <- as_tibble(penguins)

penguins
penguins_tbl

knitr::kable(penguins_tbl)

```

What is the average bill length of all penguins in the sample?

```{r penguin bill length}
penguins$bill_length_mm

mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)

```

How many penguins are female in the sample?

```{r penguin female}
penguins$sex

summary(penguins$sex)

```

How much did the smallest penguin weigh?

```{r penguin body mass}
penguins$body_mass_g

min(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)

```
