# In this lab, You will analyze data looking at the relationship between green reputation and three personality traitsâ€“ compassion, intellectual curiosity, and openness to experiences. The dataset includes data from students and non-students.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load the tidyverse package

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r data}
#import data

dictionary <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data", "green_dictionary.csv"))
green_data <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data", "green_data.csv"))
```

## 1. Inspect the item responses (e.g., with graphs or by summarizing distinct values). Is anything unusual?

```{r graphs/summaries}
#making green reputation composite variable

greenrep <- c("green1", "green2", "green3", "green4", "green5")
compassion <- c("comp1", "comp2", "comp3", "comp4", "comp5", "comp6", "comp7", "comp8", "comp9", "comp10")


green_data |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(
    id = id,
    greenrep_total = mean(c_across(green1:green5), na.rm = TRUE),
    compassion_total = mean(c_across(comp1:comp10), na.rm = TRUE),
    intelcur_total = mean(c_across(intel1:intel10), na.rm = TRUE),
    open_total = mean(c_across(open1:open10), na.rm = TRUE),
    .before = everything()
  ) |>
  head() 

#help from class 2/15
#unlist function breaks up the data and creates a large matrix basically

green_data |> 
  select(-id) |> 
  unlist() |> 
  unique()

#since we identified -99 as a value in the dataset, we can now recode

green_data <- green_data |> 
  mutate(
    across(
      -id,
           \(x) recode(x, "1" = 1, "2" = 2, "3" = 3, "4" = 4, "5" = 5, "-99" = NA_real_)
           )
  )
  
#reverse coding specific items; either look at the keying in the dictionary and write them down or select keying and filter

dictionary |> 
  filter(Keying == -1) |> 
  pull(Item)

#tedious method by running each one individually

# green_data <- green_data |> 
#   mutate(
#     green2 = recode(green2, "1"= 5, "2" = 4, "3" = 3, "4" = 2, "5" = 1)
#   )

#mutating multiple columns at once

reversed <- c( "green2", "comp6", "comp7",  "comp8", "comp9", "comp10", "intel7", "intel8", "intel9", "intel10", "open7", "open8", "open9", "open10")

green_data <- green_data |> 
  mutate(
    across(
      all_of(reversed),
      \(x) recode(x, "1" = 5, "2" = 4, "3" = 3, "4" = 2, "5" = 1)
    )
  )

#computing total scores 

green_data <- green_data |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(
    green_total = mean(c_across(green1:green5), na.rm = TRUE),
    comp_total = mean(c_across(comp1:comp10), na.rm = TRUE),
    intel_total = mean(c_across(intel1:intel10), na.rm = TRUE),
    open_total = mean(c_across(open1:open10), na.rm = TRUE),
    .after = id
  ) |> 
  ungroup()
  
#that does not seem to work hehe

#pomping

green_data <- green_data |> 
  mutate(
    across(
      green_total:open_total,
      \(x) 100 * (x-1) / (5-1),
      .names = "{.col}_pomp"
    )
  )

#plotting

ggplot(green_data) +
  aes(x = green_total_pomp) +
  geom_histogram()

#dropping NA students and creating linear lines

green_data |> 
  filter(!is.na(student)) |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = open_total_pomp, y = green_total_pomp, color = factor(student)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

```{r graphs/summaries}
green_data |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  summarize(
    mean = mean(l),
    sd = sd(lifeExp)
  )


ggplot(green_data) + 
aes(x = greenrep, y = compassion) +
  geom_point() 
```

## 2. Compute total scores for the four scales. Recode variables as needed.

```{r total scores}

```

## 3.Rescale the variables so that they go from 0-100 instead of the original range. Name the recaled variables *_pomp.

```{r rescale}

```

## 4. Make plots that illustrate the distributions of the 4 POMP-scored variables.

```{r plots}

```

## 5. Make scatterplots showing the relationships between green reputation and each personality trait. Include trend lines for students and non-students. What do these plots show?

```{r personality scatterplots}

```

## 6. Compare green reputation for students and non-students using a rainfall plot (bar + density + data points).

```{r rainfall plot}

```

## 7. Compute a summary table of means, SDs, medians, minima, and maxima for the four total scores for students and non-students.

```{r summary table}

```
