## Introduction

Welcome everyone! My name is Jude and I am a senior at the University of South
Florida. I am majoring in Psychology and Aging Sciences and hope to attend a graduate
program in Social Psychology next semester. 

Fun fact: I have visited 7 countries and love to travel in my free time!
